# shake_player

A player you can shake your head to.

## Introduction
This project is a project for the course "Mobile Computing und Internet der Dinge" (2022)
at the technical university of Karlsruhe (KIT).

The main functionality of this project is to provide a music player that can be controlled
with the movement of your head. The player has support to connect to the cosinuss earables.
The player also has experimental (untested) support for the eSense earables.
Currently only cosinuss is supported.
